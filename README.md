# C# learning projects
I am sharing here little projects I've built whilst learning C# foundations. They initially started off based on the 'Learn C#' course from Codecaademy, but I decided to change certain things and add new features to keep on experimenting.
Positive criticism is always welcome, in the spirit of self-improvement :)
